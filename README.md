### Problem Statement:
 Gamers sink a lot of hours into their gaming and most of them get little to nothing in return. Due to this reason, a lot of concerned individuals and governments have begun to limit the number of hours dedicated to gaming in general. Another problem of gaming currently is the centralisation around streamers earning the most money while others earn little to nothing.
 

### Solution: VisionMart
VisionMart is a platform which allows social gamers to compete and earn, simultaneously. There are various games and rewards at this platform.The vision is to make esports accessible to all gamers. As it is well known that there are a no. of players who want themselves to be noted by the esports company, for which they had to go through various steps.

Giving gamers ownership over in-game assets and allowing them to increase their value by actively playing the game are key components of the play-to-earn business model. By participating in the in-game economy, players are creating value for other players and the developers. In turn they are rewarded with in-game assets. These digital assets can be anything ranging from cryptocurrencies to in-game resources that are tokenized on the blockchain. That’s why the play-to-earn business model goes very well together with blockchain games.
Blockchain games have the potential to transform the gaming industry for the better. Players who spend money on such games - or even contribute to the gaming metaverse as free-to-play gamers - can claim ownership of in-game items through this technology.
 
What makes play2earn intriguing is the fact that players can not only control in-game assets but also trade and sell them.

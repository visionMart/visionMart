### Problem Statement:
 Gamers sink a lot of hours into their gaming and most of them get little to nothing in return. Due to this reason, a lot of concerned individuals and governments have begun to limit the number of hours dedicated to gaming in general. Another problem of gaming currently is the centralisation around streamers earning the most money while others earn little to nothing.

The core values of VisionMart have been selected on the basis of providing a solution to issues associated with the unprotected rights of esports participants, fixing esports' broken business model (fragmented ecosystem creates complexity, friction and misalignment between involved parties), and esports' increasingly polarized ecosystem.

VisionMart is a platform which allows social gamers to compete and earn, simultaneously. There are various games and rewards at this platform.The vision is to make esports accessible to all gamers. As it is well known that there are a no. of players who want themselves to be noted by the esports company, for which they had to go through various steps.

Giving gamers ownership over in-game assets and allowing them to increase their value by actively playing the game are key components of the play-to-earn business model. By participating in the in-game economy, players are creating value for other players and the developers. In turn they are rewarded with in-game assets. These digital assets can be anything ranging from cryptocurrencies to in-game resources that are tokenized on the blockchain. That’s why the play-to-earn business model goes very well together with blockchain games.
Blockchain games have the potential to transform the gaming industry for the better. Players who spend money on such games - or even contribute to the gaming metaverse as free-to-play gamers - can claim ownership of in-game items through this technology.
 
What makes play2earn intriguing is the fact that players can not only control in-game assets but also trade and sell them.
To the growing audience, we connect sponsors and advertisers. Advertisers may find themselves in profit with the digital players as gamers watch and consume esports more religiously than the traditional sports fans. So, basically, esports fans are an untapped market for the advertisers and this will soon be recognized. Our platform is being built on the Solana platform, avoiding scaling issues such as implementing layer 2 protocols, to bring profitable gaming experiences to the world’s 2 billion gamers.
